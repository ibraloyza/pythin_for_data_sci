# understand tuples in python as a data structure
# A tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and unchangeable. In Python, tuples are written with round brackets.
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Tuples are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python.
# Tuples are immutable, meaning that you cannot change their content without changing their identity.
# Tuples can contain items of different data types, including other tuples.
# Tuples are indexed, meaning that you can access individual items in a tuple using their index.
# Tuples can be sliced, meaning that you can access a range of items in a tuple using their index.
# Tuples can be iterated, meaning that you can loop through the items in a tuple using a for loop.
#  how to create a tuple in python and how does it work
# Here is an example of a tuple in Python:
fruits =  ("apple","banaana", "cherry", "mango","orange" );
print(f"the tuple items in the fruits tuple is : {fruits}");

# what is the difference between a list and a tuple in python
# the main difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable, meaning that you can change its content without changing its identity, while a tuple is immutable, meaning that you cannot change its content without changing its identity.
# Here is an example of accessing individual items in a tuple using their index:
print(f"this is the first iten in the fruits tuple is : {fruits[3]}");
# here is an example of  methods in the tuples
